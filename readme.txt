Hi! To run CARA (the computer-aided recipe assistant), just run the interface.py file: it'll boot up the conversational interface.

There's an included requirements.txt with all of the Python requirements for the assignment as well. This was made with conda and might not work - feel free to contact us if that's the case and we can try and troubleshoot
